        <h3>problem</h3>
        <p>Tuft & Needle started with a single product, the T&N Original mattress. As the company started growing and launching different products the admin was falling short of capabilities to support the needs of the business, CX team, and customers.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="left">

      <div class="right">
        <p class= "explanation">As the company grew, the list of products for sale increased dramatically. T&N went from selling 1 mattress, to now having around 24+ bedding products on the site. The backend system created by one of the founders had worked for many years, but the CX team had started to include more tools in their workflow such as multiple spreadsheets
        and calculators to figure out promotions or get money back to customers. They also had to create a separate order for every product which was creating confusion to the customer causing an upticks in calls, emails and chat questions about this.</p>


        <p class= "explanation">There were 4 main goals to be solved with the re-design: </p>


        <ol>
         <li> Ability to apply promotions to individual orders and mutliple orders and to view amount discounted per line item when an order had multiple items.</li>
         <li> Ability to have multiple items within a shipment.</li>
         <li> Adding a fulfillment request section (state before an order becomes a shipment), at this state a CX could take early action to specific items or entire order such as changing or canceling.</li>
         <li> Create a visual refresh of the order summary page to support the new added features.</li>

    <p>More real state was needed as we added more information and actions. To gain sapce, the history column
    could now be collpased. CX's workflow &amp; feedback the way we prioritized information in columns.
   The visual design system created used
the primary CTA buttons (pill style) for main flows and tertiary style (underlined body copy) for secondary flows. The previous design had all the action buttons at the top represented by separate links. We decided to consolidate these
in a dropdown called "Manage".  </p>

    <p class="zoom-in">Line Items <p>

    <p>In the re-design single line items can be expanded to display relevant information (history, notes, trials). CX reps needed specific information about each of the items in an order: how much money was discounted based on a prmotion applied to the order? If the user replaced or
      returned an item the information needed to be at the line item level not at the global level for the records. Ability to add notes, so that other reps would know any important information about what had happened. The biggest change was the visualization of multiple items in an order
      since that was not possible before from a back-end standpoint.

      <p class="zoom-in">Fulfillment Request &amp; Shipments<p>

    <p>A new section called "Fulfillment Requests" represent orders that have been sent to the fulfiller but are in a processing state, not yet accepted.
      In this state the CX reps can take actions such as, canceling, replacing/changing items. The limitations for shipments are different
      because at this point the fulfiller has taken action towards getting the items to the customer. The menus in each of the sections reflect the actions that can be taken in each instance.
      A tag system &amp; color system was introduced to identify different stages of the shipments. Additionally, two tabs to differentiate active vs inactive states to reduce cognitive load for the user.

    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>Through shadowing, interviews and testing I collected CX &amp; backend engineering feedback that inspired the solutions
      explored throughout the process. Through the discover phase these were the most important issues to tackle:</p>

    </div>

  <div class="list">
    <p class="zoom-in">Promotions<p>
      <ol>
        <li>Promotions were being calculated manually by the team, which resulted in extended times for the CX workflow.</li>
        <li>The reparation feature (designed for another purpose) was being used to credit money from promotions. This made it hard to calculate
        reimbursements for individual items when customers returned items.</li>
        <li>Most promotions were being created to take money off purchases above a specific threshold, e.g. “$100 off of $1000”.
          Our team would honor the promotion even if the customer had spent $1000+ on more than 1 order. Thus, CX reps were doing calculations manually for this scenario as well.</li>
      </ol>

    </div>

    <div class="list">

      <p class="zoom-in">New Shipment + Line Item Interaction<p>
        <ol>
          <li>Every item placed as part of a single order through a call, chat or email had to be created as a separate order, these would result in separate shipments.</li>
          <li>Backend was preparing to move to a multiple items per order system and the interface had to support the changes. </li>
          <li>The shipment level functinality had to extend to items within shipments.</li>
          <li>More affordance was needed to identify different stages &amp; states of shipments.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="extra-info">
      <h3>Opportunities</h3>
      <p>The features &amp; UX/UI components of this system had not been touched by a designer since the company began. From a
        feature standpoint there were business requirements &amp; user requirements that were mentioned above that needed to be tackled.
        From a design perspective I saw the following items as big opportunities to improve the experience of the user:</p>

  <br>

        <li><span>Improve Layout</span>, to support new features &amp; improve workflow.</li>
        <li><span>New Interaction Patterns &amp; Design System</span>, to unify design, improve affordance &amp; accessibility.</li>
        <li><span>Clear status &amp; tagging system</span>, to increase visiblity of important messages.</li>

    <!--<p class= "explanation">These had all been customer requests for years in our backlog, as they solved key use cases for our users to collaborate with their teammates and provide feedback. However, because they were unable to do this in Box, we were forcing our use other software to annotate and markup their content. This created an annoying back-and-forth process
    for our users who simply stored their content in Box, but did the actual editing and iteration elsewhere.</p>-->

      <h3>Outcome</h3>
      <p>This project's scope was a beast, and we spent about 2 months in the design phase while the backend devs were working on some of the major changes.
      Some of the front-end changes were implementes, but many were not.Ultimately, the scope was too large given the time-frame and availablity of the developers
    in the team. </p>


  <br>
        <p>What would I have done different today? Below a few of the things I can think about this project in hindsight:</p>


  <br>
        <p class="zoom-in">Scope Creep in MVPs</p>
        <p>There was too much to tackle in the MVP version and the team should've been more realistic of what could be done within a defined time frame. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="zoom-in">Testing &amp; Feature Iteration</p>
        <p>This has been a theme throughout some of my projects. Designing multiple features at the same time is exciting but we risk an experimenting &amp: testing approach. Concentrating
        on specific features one at a time, iterating and testing might result in getting things out the door faster and learning through user feedback with the real thing.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="zoom-in">Promotions</p>
        <p>These have become such a large part of the business that I would've liked to create a different system for appliying them to orders. Instead of triggering a promo flow from the
        general information of the order it could've been interesting to explore activating it from the individual items in the order. </p>
