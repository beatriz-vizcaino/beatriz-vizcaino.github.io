        <h3>problem</h3>


          <p>Aetna users weren't aware of health transparency and health information apps available to them since most if the interaction they had with their
          health insurace was through the Aetna.com site. How could we create a unified application that could support users through various health scenarios by unifying the existing features from the different services Aetna owned?</p>

      </div>

    </section>


    <section class="four">

      <div class="left">
      </div>

      <div class="right">
        <p class= "explanation">The search experience from WellMatch, which was being integrated with the new features, had been one of the biggest pain-points for users. Search terms that would be used by people such as "baby doctor" or "knee pain" would not return
        the results expected from the user. Many times resulting in an empty result and most time users would leave the application thinking it was not working at all. </p>

        <p class= "explanation">My challenge was to create an organic search experience that would
      return results for common search terms. The results needed to adapat to any of the scenarios the user was in: <br> 1. Looking for estimates on how much a service would cost, 2. Looking for a doctor, 3. Having some pain and just wanting to know what to do, 4. Getting a better undertanding of how many services make up a "care episode" such as a surgery and how much would that cost.</p>

      <p class= "explanation">Designing a search experience was tough since most of the users expect any search experience to be intelligent as Google, where any word types results in something relevant. Our challenge was to match our back-end capabilities to a User Experience and flow that could help users with a specific amount of results without confusing them. </p>

  <p>The new search flow allowed users to enter simple terms and explore mutliple paths forward: Finding Health Information or Finding Care. The search results were expanded to show terms that didn't match the exact same word but were related from a healthcare standpoint.</p>

    <h2>Benefits in Context</h2>

    <p>Consolidating the search experience with benefit information was key in the sucess of this project. For the health information scenario I included care options, understanding that this would be the users' next step after searching for a specific condition.
    At a glance the UI shows different pricing levels that allow the user to understand the different range of pricing available for their specific need. </p>

    <p>Once an option is selected users can see a breakdown of the total price and understand how their sponsor & health insurance benefits affect the final cost. The price breakdown changes

    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>Viewing global insurance benefits was the main scenario for Aetna users, within Aetna,
      but outside Aetna, they were looking for resources that allowed them to better understand a condition by searching online about it and how to treat it. Some patients wanted
      care information which would allow them to treat a small issue at home, others wanted to go to the doctor. Additionally, as high deductible plans were being offered more and more by companies,
    users were confused as why they had to paid specific amounts are we looking for ways to minimize those costs but there weren't any tools available for them. Below is a list of the user's pain-points
  we aimed to tackle with the design: </p>

    </div>

  <div class="list">
      <ol>
        <li>Users considered cumbersome having to download multiple apps for different purposes.</li>
        <li>Users were confused about the ways high deductible plans functioned and didn't understand the current UI used to explain it within Aetna.</li>
        <li>Users wanted to use simple "layman" terms to start a search inside a health application.</li>
        <li>Users wanted to store personal information such as medications, doctors, previous procedures and for this information to allow for more personalization within the app.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="extra-info">
      <h3>Opportunities</h3>
      <p>The impact and importance this project had for the business at the moment was key to the future of the digital component of Aetna's business.
      The broader Aetna business knew a lot about health insurance but nothing about providing visualization or support through a digital platform. The business was losing customers, because
    they now wanted feature parity with what other competitors were doing, which was offering a suite of features that would support users and would inform them on the end cost for the invididual
  and the business through different digital touchpoints. The business had also invested in the two start-ups that had merged and needed to show the result of the investment by showcasing a potential product solution
 that would combine the best of both startups.</p>


  <br>
        <p>By focusing on the following design opportunities our team was able to come up with a final proposal for the business: </p>


  <br>

    <ul>
        <li><span>Search as Hero</span>, this allowed users to take action and get to a result within a few clicks.</li>
        <li><span>Intuitive Typeahead</span>, allowed users to get mutliple results and paths (finding care &amp; health information) once they typed simple words.</li>
        <li><span>Up-Front Pricing &amp; Benefits in Context</span>, allowed users to see benefit information even before they had seen a doctor or gone through a procedure.
        This would enabled education &amp; planning.</li>
        <li><span>Healthspae</span>, a space to store personal information that would then influence the results seen by the user.</li>
    <ul>

    <h2>Exploration <br> &amp; Iteration</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="right">
    <p class= "explanation">In the intial stages of the project, I explored different ways in which we could approach the opportunities identified. We explored having the app center around the personalized information first, envisioning a system
    that would visualize a health journey for the user with a timeline and from there diverge into other tasks. Ultimately we decided to simplify that concept, and create a homepage that would allow insurance sponsors to add information relevant
  to their employees but also encourage them to take health actions such as having a health-check every year or selecting a primary care physician if they didn't have one.  </p>


    <!--<p class= "explanation">We also explored the concept of starting </p>-->

  <div class="right">
    <p class="zoom-in">5 Things To-Do</p>
    <p class= "explanation">The team continued iterating in the 5 things to do concept which led us to create a swiping card concept to get the user engaged with the app.</p>


    <p class= "explanation">From research we had learned users felt overwhelmed with the amount of health information they were finding through their web searches.
      With the 5 things concept, everytime the user opened their app they would be encouraged to try or explore 5 things. By doing this we would also benefit the employer
    who ultimately had a stake in getting their employees use the app so their costs would be reduced.</p>

      <h3>Outcome</h3>
      <p>This was an interesting project for me to work on and I had the opportunity to collaborate with many people, figure out interesting
      challenges and get a lot of user feedback. However, this product never launched as shown above, because this was meant to live as a sub-brand within
    Aetna digital. At the end Aetna digital fully absorbed the team and capabilities and the work shown here was then implemented within that team which I didn't make part of since I left the company
  a few months later. </p>


  <br>
        <p>Below is a summary of takeaways from this project:</p>


  <br>
        <p class="zoom-in">Incremental Changes</p>
        <p>If I were to look back and do things differently (assuming I had enough power to make these decisons) I would've recommended
          we start making the changes within one of the apps. Rather than eliminating the 2 legacy apps, I would've continued supporting the one with most users, and
        iterated on specific issues from there. Slowly adding more functionality that would have allowed to eventually get to full combination of features. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="zoom-in"> Prioritize Trust &amp; Relationships for New Teams</p>
        <p>Getting 2 teams to work as one is hard and it takes time to get into a flow. As a design leader (which I am today) I now know that if I'm ever in a similar situation I would
        need to have patience and prioritize team trust &amp; relationships since at the end of the day that will impact the quality of the work produced. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="zoom-in">User Empathy is Powerful</p>
        <p>User Interviews &amp; research are powerful tools to promote features that otherwise stakeholders would not care about.</p>
