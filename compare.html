      <div class="context">
        <p>Difficulty in understanding product differences was one of the main feedback we heard recurrently from T&N's customers.  Although we had implemented a compare page a few years back, the page did not explain features differences one-to-one from one model to another. Furthermore, users' interaction in the old mobile design was not discoverable and was causing usability issues.

        <h3>problem</h3>
        <p>Our team had a goal of improving the conversion rate on the T&N site (with a mobile focus). We deemed the compare page a critical page affecting the conversion rate. We received feedback that users want to understand the differences between products from the get-go and based on the quantitative data collected.

        </p>


        <ol>
         <li> Increase the affordance of the mattress selector interaction on mobile. </li>
         <li> Create an easy 1-1 feature comparison. We proposed doing this by improving copywriting and layout to make the differences easy to scan and quickly understand differentiation. </li>
         <li> Reducing the length of the page and avoid sections with paragraphs.</li>
         <li> Add a description to the technical terms needed to explain the product's construction; Enhancing the comparison experience.</li>

    <p class="zoom-in">One-to-One Feature Comparison<p>

    <p>Users were having issues comparing features among the different mattress models. The team used a table layout with bullet points & improved the content to answer the questions we heard from customers related to differentiation. Additionally, compared to the previous design, we created shared categories that could be compared 1-1 from one model to another. We thought, presenting the content in bullets or short sentences and visualizing in a table format will be conducive to quicker recognition and comprehension of the content. </p>

    <p class="zoom-in">Tool Tips For Technical Terms<p>

    <p>Customers didn't understand the specific terminology used to describe the layers and materials of the mattresses. To solve this problem, the team simplified the language and avoided technical jargon as much as possible. When we had to use technical terms, we introduced tooltips to help when the content is not fully understood.

      <p class="zoom-in">2-Column Layout &amp; Sticky Headers<p>

    <p>With the previous mobile design, customers didn't realize they could swipe through to see different models. This interaction pattern was not conducive to view models side by side. By implementing a 2 column layout, users can now see two models simultaneously. Additionally,  a new dropdown interaction helps them switch from one model to another. Furthermore, we added sticky headers provide more context to the user as they scrolled down the page.

    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>Through a mix of research tools like Hotjar (heatmaps, interactions), heuristic analysis, UX benchmarking, competitive audit, qualitative testing, the team compiled a list of user pain points, some of which are listed below:
</p>

    </div>

  <div class="list">
      <ol>
        <li>Users have a hard time understanding what's the difference is between the experience of the Hybrid mattress vs a spring or foam mattress</li>
        <li>Users expect to easily find reviews that align with their own preferences and experiences. No easy way to do that on the site. Customers are looking for solutions to their specific needs (back pain, rheumatoid arthritis) and there's a lack of personalization/suggestion process in the site for people with specific needs.</li>
        <li>Similar types of information scattered throughout the page results in confusion and scrolling fatigue -- cooling, support and firmness.</li>
        <li>Users prefer the more detailed illustrations on Purple's (competitor) cutaway diagram. They appreciate seeing how thick the mattress is and the individual layers</li>
        <li>Users make different conclusions about firmness of the mattresses due to lack of explicit information. "Original seems the most firm." "Hybrid has springs, so most firm." "Hybrid has pillowtop, so most soft".</li>
        <li>Users don't realize you can swipe through the mattress compare columns due to lack of visible affordance.</li>
      </ol>

    </div>

  <div class="extra-info">
      <h3>Opportunities</h3>
      <p>Conversion rate and usability goals were at the forefront of our design decisions. We focused on the mobile experience knowing this was a big area for growth and there were lots of opportunities for improvement.</p>
      The following were important themes deemed as opportunities and explored continually through the design process:<p>

  </div>

    <div class="list">

        <ol>
          <li><span>Augment Affordances</span>, increase discoverablity for essential interactions.</li>
          <li><span>Create a path for future personalization features;</span>The ultimate goal was to combine this page with a personalization tool that would recommend the best option for the user. We needed to improve the baseline to allow for that to happen in the future.</li>
          <li><span>Improve Copy</span>, clear, direct and layman's terms for descriptions and categories were necessary for this experience to provide value to the end user.</li>
          <li><span>Visuals & short sentences/bullets</span>, to create a better experience for those who are quickly glancing through the differences.</li>

    <p class= "explanation">As a design leader, my role was to ideate along with Rachel (Designer), synthesize insights into actionable ideas, help prioritize features considered, and provide UX & UI direction and feedback. Rachel and I frequently relied the creating of prototypes and getting user feedback throughout the process. CX, Engineering, and the rest of the design team also provided input in the process. Below you can find some of the iterations we went through before
    landing on final directions for the difference pieces of the design.</p>


    <!--<p class= "explanation">These had all been customer requests for years in our backlog, as they solved key use cases for our users to collaborate with their teammates and provide feedback. However, because they were unable to do this in Box, we were forcing our use other software to annotate and markup their content. This created an annoying back-and-forth process
    for our users who simply stored their content in Box, but did the actual editing and iteration elsewhere.</p>-->

      <h3>Outcome</h3>
      <p>I wanted this project to follow best in class e-commerce patterns for our specific customers and emphasized the importance of continually using research to validate our assumptions. Experimentation has also been a big part of this since the design proposes variations in how the information can be presented to enable a learning process through metrics. Furthermore, each portion of the design has been released and measured against the original to demonstrate this project's overall value to the business.</p>


  <br>
        <p>Here's a list of important challenges and learnings for this project:</p>


  <br>
        <p class="zoom-in">A/B Test as tool for measuring impact</p>
        <p>It's been great to A/B test against the original version and see how much revenue we've made with small changes. When the interstitial was launched, we saw a significant increment in our CRO.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="zoom-in">Eng Collab</p>
        <p>Tight collaboration with Engineering has been vital in the success of this project. Sharing A/B testing, user-testing, and interaction recording results has won buy-in on many of the proposed things.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="zoom-in">Feature Iteration</p>
        <p>Coming up with an implementation plan with engineering has allowed us to see results within weeks. Designing with an iterative mindset has allowed the business to understand that even when we have design vision, it is meant to be implemented in portions and that the paced releases will enable us to learn &amp; iterate that vision as we go.
