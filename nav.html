        <h3>problem</h3>
        <p>Based on the nav, customers' perception was that T&N was less established and had fewer products than our competitors.</p>
        <p>Additionally, Tuft & Needle's navigation was not scalable. As we added more products to the lineup, the navigation was becoming cumbersome for the customer, and it was hard to understand from the get-go what Tuft & Needle was about and products that were sold on the site.</p>

         <li> Improved brand perception. With more products and ability to view products we sell, users see T&N as a well established company with a diverse catalog of products.</li>
         <li> Improved usability & user journey, while supporting 10x increase in product offerings. Customers take less time finding items on the site and have the ability to navigate to product list pages to view categories of products.</li>
         <li> X per day revenue increase in our CR. I was able to measure difference between navigation and we saw a X lift in our conversion per day, which is an estimated X per year of additional revenue. </li>

    <p class="zoom-in">Two Layers<p>

    <p>To help the user quickly identify the links that would take them down a shopping path vs those that would suppport that process I decided to create a transactional and a non-transactional navigation.  I Played around with the logo lockup, ultimately went with the simpler logo. As a startup brand recognition is important thus clarity in how we present our name was key. The second lockup also allowed to create a clear division between the two nav levels, which enabled a sticky nav interaction for the transactional nav.</p>

    <p class="zoom-in">Hover States for Context<p>

    <p>Through research, I had learned that users wanted to understand the product differences right off the bat. At the time, we didn’t have a compare page, so I thought it would be a vehicle to accomplish that goal. Initially, I thought the hover state could provide more info for the mattresses, and for the other products, it could show the image. The final designs have the product information copy displayed at all times.  By adding descriptive information below the mattresses, we saw an increase in the CR of 20k per day. Additionally, the hover states show an image of human interaction with the product to show comfort & softness, qualities that are not easy to see/feel when buying a mattress online.

      <p class="zoom-in">Mattresses as Hero & Priority+</p>

    <p>By understanding that 85% of our revenue comes from mattress purchases, I decided our nav needed to highlight them as the "heroes." We had limited real-estate on mobile; still, we thought mattresses required images and information since so many customers were looking for answers related to these products.</p>
    <br>

    <p>As we thought more about the nav's interaction, we wanted to avoid hiding important information for the user even when the viewport started shrinking. We A/B tested the different mobile concepts and decided on a final direction based on the performance of the established metrics. As a result, the mattresses and more variant won by pulling an additional $40 per order compared to the other variants.

    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>Through qualitative feedback collected in the discovery phase of this project, we learned:
</p>

    </div>

  <div class="list">
      <ol>
        <li>User's perception of our site (when looking at the nav)was that other competitor sites were more established and had more products.</li>
        <li>Users communicated it wasn't clear if we sold any other products (different than mattresses).</li>
        <li>Users weren't satisfied with the navgiation experience since it was cumbersome.</li>
        <li>Users wanted to understand what the differences and what the products were from the get-go.</li>
      </ol>

  <div class="extra-info">
      <h3>Opportunities</h3>
      <p>This project was self-started. It was not in a planned roadmap, but I saw the need as I had been conducting research for the site and competitor sites. I pitched the idea to the
      founder (with support from my manager) and started talking to the dev team to understand if they a developer that could be dedicated to work on this with me in 2 sprints. The opportunities I saw
    from implementing the change were the following: </p>

  </div>

    <div class="list">

        <ol>
          <li><span>More visibility into the brand &amp; what the company is about.</span></li>
          <li><span>More brand recognition, trust &amp; satisfaction.</span></li>
          <li><span>Leveraging the photography assets (deemed by customers as a key component of the brand) to anticipate a user need of providing early visibility to commit to further explore a product.</li>
          <li><span>A mobile navgiation that doesn't hide important links for the user.</li>

    <!--<p class= "explanation">These had all been customer requests for years in our backlog, as they solved key use cases for our users to collaborate with their teammates and provide feedback. However, because they were unable to do this in Box, we were forcing our use other software to annotate and markup their content. This created an annoying back-and-forth process
    for our users who simply stored their content in Box, but did the actual editing and iteration elsewhere.</p>-->

      <h3>Outcome</h3>
      <p>I wanted this project to follow best in class e-commerce patterns for our specific customers and emphasized the importance of continually using research to validate our assumptions. Experimentation has also been a big part of this since the design proposes variations in how the information can be presented to enable a learning process through metrics. Furthermore, each portion of the design has been released and measured against the original to demonstrate this project's overall value to the business.</p>


  <br>
        <p>Here's a list of important challenges and learnings for this project:</p>


  <br>
        <p class="zoom-in">A/B Test as tool for measuring impact</p>
        <p>It's been great to A/B test against the original version and see how much revenue we've made with small changes. When the interstitial was launched, we saw a significant increment in our CRO.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="zoom-in">Eng Collab</p>
        <p>Tight collaboration with Engineering has been vital in the success of this project. Sharing A/B testing, user-testing, and interaction recording results has won buy-in on many of the proposed things.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="zoom-in">Feature Iteration</p>
        <p>Coming up with an implementation plan with engineering has allowed us to see results within weeks. Designing with an iterative mindset has allowed the business to understand that even when we have design vision, it is meant to be implemented in portions and that the paced releases will enable us to learn &amp; iterate that vision as we go.
