        <h3>problem</h3>
        <p>Based on the nav, customers' perception was that T&N was less established and had fewer products than our competitors.</p>
        <p>Additionally, Tuft & Needle's navigation was not scalable. As we added more products to the lineup, the navigation was becoming cumbersome for the customer, and it was hard to understand from the get-go what Tuft & Needle was about and products that were sold on the site.</p>

         <li> Improved brand perception. With more products and ability to view products we sell, users see T&N as a well established company with a diverse catalog of products.</li>
         <li> Improved usability & user journey, while supporting 10x increase in product offerings. Customers take less time finding items on the site and have the ability to navigate to product list pages to view categories of products.</li>
         <li> X per day revenue increase in our CR. I was able to measure difference between navigation and we saw a X lift in our conversion per day, which is an estimated X per year of additional revenue. </li>

    <p class="zoom-in">Two Layers<p>

    <p>To help the user quickly identify the links that would take them down a shopping path vs those that would suppport that process I decided to create a transactional and a non-transactional navigation.  I Played around with the logo lockup, ultimately went with the simpler logo. As a startup brand recognition is important thus clarity in how we present our name was key. The second lockup also allowed to create a clear division between the two nav levels, which enabled a sticky nav interaction for the transactional nav.</p>

    <p class="zoom-in">Hover States for Context<p>

    <p>Through research, I had learned that users wanted to understand the product differences right off the bat. At the time, we didn’t have a compare page, so I thought it would be a vehicle to accomplish that goal. Initially, I thought the hover state could provide more info for the mattresses, and for the other products, it could show the image. The final designs have the product information copy displayed at all times.  By adding descriptive information below the mattresses, we saw an increase in the CR of 20k per day. Additionally, the hover states show an image of human interaction with the product to show comfort & softness, qualities that are not easy to see/feel when buying a mattress online.

      <p class="zoom-in">Mattresses as Hero & Priority+</p>

    <p>By understanding that 85% of our revenue comes from mattress purchases, I decided our nav needed to highlight them as the "heroes." We had limited real-estate on mobile; still, we thought mattresses required images and information since so many customers were looking for answers related to these products.</p>
    <br>

    <p>As we thought more about the nav's interaction, we wanted to avoid hiding important information for the user even when the viewport started shrinking. We A/B tested the different mobile concepts and decided on a final direction based on the performance of the established metrics. As a result, the mattresses and more variant won by pulling an additional $40 per order compared to the other variants.

    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>Through a mix of research tools like Hotjar (heatmaps, interactions), heuristic analysis, UX benchmarking, competitive audit, qualitative testing, the team compiled a list of user pain points, some of which are listed below:
</p>

    </div>

  <div class="list">
      <ol>
        <li>Users don’t know how to change shipping options when it’s not visible during checkout. Some users don’t see the order summary section. And even when they open it, their eyes skip over the shipping section.</li>
        <li>Users have the impression that the one-page checkout is shorter and faster.</li>
        <li>Users are confused about multiple promotion interaction/stacking.</li>
        <li>Cart: users leverage cart as a comparison tool, not necessarily to purchase.</li>
        <li>Cart: We do not provide an estimated shipping cost or shipping options upfront that can affect cart costs.</li>
        <li>Shipping: in-store pickup should be made available to users who want to save on shipping and pick up the same day.</li>
      </ol>

    </div>

  <div class="extra-info">
      <h3>Opportunities</h3>
      <p>The checkout re-design project has been an important goal for the overall business, and our conversion rate goals for the year are heavily reliant on the success of this project. The team prioritized the following opportunities over a long list of changes to slowly roll out features and measure each of the features against specific goals.</p>

  </div>

    <div class="list">

        <ol>
          <li><span>Information Upfront</span>, by adding fee &amp; tax information at the cart level and PDP level, we are ensuring users won't be surprised at checkout and avoiding abandoned carts.</li>
          <li><span>Express checkout options</span>, customers expect these payment options to be ubiquitous as they are purchasing more from mobile, and entering all required information becomes cumbersome in this context.  </li>
          <li><span>Improved layout for visibility &amp; readability of important information</span>, such as shipping estimates, promo pricing &amp; delay/warning messages.</li>
          <li><span>Restructuring of required personal information with microinteracions in the right places</span>, to create the perception of a shorter process.</li>

  <div class="right">
    <p class= "explanation">As a design manager, my role was to ideate along with Brooke (Designer), synthesize insights into actionable ideas, help prioritize features considered, and provide UX & UI direction and feedback. As the two designers in the team, Brooke &amp; I frequently relied on user feedback to improve our designs. CX, Engineering, and the rest of the design team also provided input in the process. Ultimately our goal with the visual design was to improve the Aesthetic and implement a minimal design to allow for the critical information to be processed by the end-user.</p>


    <!--<p class= "explanation">These had all been customer requests for years in our backlog, as they solved key use cases for our users to collaborate with their teammates and provide feedback. However, because they were unable to do this in Box, we were forcing our use other software to annotate and markup their content. This created an annoying back-and-forth process
    for our users who simply stored their content in Box, but did the actual editing and iteration elsewhere.</p>-->

      <h3>Outcome</h3>
      <p>I wanted this project to follow best in class e-commerce patterns for our specific customers and emphasized the importance of continually using research to validate our assumptions. Experimentation has also been a big part of this since the design proposes variations in how the information can be presented to enable a learning process through metrics. Furthermore, each portion of the design has been released and measured against the original to demonstrate this project's overall value to the business.</p>


  <br>
        <p>Here's a list of important challenges and learnings for this project:</p>


  <br>
        <p class="zoom-in">A/B Test as tool for measuring impact</p>
        <p>It's been great to A/B test against the original version and see how much revenue we've made with small changes. When the interstitial was launched, we saw a significant increment in our CRO.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="zoom-in">Eng Collab</p>
        <p>Tight collaboration with Engineering has been vital in the success of this project. Sharing A/B testing, user-testing, and interaction recording results has won buy-in on many of the proposed things.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="zoom-in">Feature Iteration</p>
        <p>Coming up with an implementation plan with engineering has allowed us to see results within weeks. Designing with an iterative mindset has allowed the business to understand that even when we have design vision, it is meant to be implemented in portions and that the paced releases will enable us to learn &amp; iterate that vision as we go.
