    <h2>Transactions Framework</h2>

    <p>Consolidating the search experience with benefits information was vital in the success of this project. For the health information scenario, I included care options, understanding that this would be the next step after searching for a specific condition. At a glance, the UI shows different pricing levels that allow the user to understand the diverse range of pricing available for their particular need.</p>

    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>Viewing global insurance benefits was the main scenario for Aetna users within Aetna, but outside Aetna (in other sites), they were looking for resources that allowed them to better understand a condition by searching online about treating it. Some patients wanted care information, which would enable them to treat at home; others wanted to go to the primary care doctor, urgent care, or specialist. Additionally, as high deductible plans were being offered more and more by companies, users were confused about why they had to pay specific amounts. Many were looking for ways to minimize those costs, but there weren't any tools available. Below is a list of the user's pain-points we aimed to tackle with the design: </p>

    </div>

  <div class="list">
      <ol>
        <li>Users considered cumbersome having to download multiple apps for different purposes.</li>
        <li>Users were confused about how high deductible plans functioned and didn't understand how the Aetna site explained those.</li>
        <li>Users wanted to use simple "layman" terms to start a search inside a health application.</li>
        <li>Users wanted to store personal information such as medications, doctors, and previous procedures to allow for more personalization.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="extra-info">
      <h3>Opportunities</h3>
      <p>The impact and importance this project had for the business at the moment was key to the future of the digital component of Aetna's business. The broader Aetna business knew a lot about health insurance but nothing about providing visualization or support through a digital platform. The company was losing customers because they wanted feature parity with what other competitors were doing, offering a suite of features that would support users and inform them on the end cost for the individual and the business through different digital touchpoints. Additionally, Aetna had invested in two start-ups that had merged and needed to show the investment result by showcasing a potential product solution that would combine both.</p>


  <br>
        <p>Our team came up with a final proposal for the business by focusing on the following design opportunities:</p>


  <br>

    <ul>
        <li><span>Search as Hero</span>;this allowed users to take action and get to a result within a few clicks.</li>
        <li><span>Intuitive Typeahead</span> allowed users to get multiple results and paths (finding care &amp; health information) once they typed simple words.</li>
        <li><span>Up-Front Pricing &amp; Benefits in Context</span>, enabling users to see benefits information through the search experience, helping with education & planning.</li>
        <li><span>Healthspace</span>, a section to store personal data that would feed personalization features.</li>
    <ul>

    <h2>Exploration <br> &amp; Iteration</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="right">
    <p class= "explanation">In the initial stages of the project, I explored different ways to approach the opportunities identified. We explored having the app center around the personalized information first, envisioning a system that would visualize a health journey for the user with a timeline and diverge into other tasks. Ultimately we decided to simplify that concept and create a homepage that would allow insurance sponsors to add information relevant to their employees and encourage them to take health actions such as having a health-check every year or selecting a primary care physician if they didn't have one.</p>

    <p class="zoom-in">5 Things To-Do</p>
    <p class= "explanation">The team continued iterating in a concept called "five things," which led us to create a swiping card interaction.</p>


    <p class= "explanation">We had learned users felt overwhelmed with the amount of health information they were finding through their web searches from research. With the five things concept, every time the user opened their app, they would be encouraged to explore only five items. Increased interaction with the app would benefit the employer, who had a stake in getting their employees to use the app &ndash;assuming this would help them be healthier&ndash;to reduce company health costs.</p>

      <h3>Outcome</h3>
      <p>This was an exciting project for me to work on, and I had the opportunity to collaborate with many people, figure out exciting challenges, and get a lot of user feedback. However, this product never launched as shown above, because it was meant to live as a sub-brand within Aetna digital. In the end, Aetna digital fully absorbed the team and capabilities, and the work shown here was then implemented within that team, which I didn't make part of since I left the company a few months later.</p>


  <br>
        <p>Below is a summary of takeaways from this project:</p>


  <br>
        <p class="zoom-in">Incremental Changes</p>
        <p>If I were to look back and do things differently (assuming I had enough power to make these decisions), I would've recommended we start making the changes within one of the apps. Rather than eliminating the two legacy apps, I would've continued supporting the one with most users and iterate on specific issues. Slowly adding more functionality that would have allowed to get to the full combination of features eventually.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="zoom-in"> Prioritize Trust &amp; Relationships for New Teams</p>
        <p>Getting two teams to work as one is hard, and it takes time to get into a flow. As a design leader (which I am today), I now know that if I'm ever in a similar situation, I would need to have patience and prioritize team trust & relationships since that will impact the work's quality.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="zoom-in">User Empathy is Powerful</p>
        <p>User Interviews &amp; research are powerful tools to promote features that otherwise, stakeholders would not be aware of or deem important.
