      <div class="context">
        <p>The checkout experience for the tuftandneedle.com site had been re-designed a few years back. It was time to update it since
          it was falling short on conversion rates, usability best-practices and features required to best serve customers.

        <h3>problem</h3>
        <p>According to competitive research, the mobile conversion rate should be 1/3 that of desktop, but the tuftandneedle.com site mobile experience was falling short. An audit identified that usability issues and missing features such as express
        pay were stopping customers from finalizing their purchase on mobile.</p>

      <div class="right">
        <p class= "explanation">With the above in mind the team established a goal of increasing the mobile conversion rate by 14%. Most of the focus was put on improving the mobile experience, but all of the new features and changes also extended to desktop.
        </p>


        <p class= "explanation">Additional goals were initially identified: </p>


        <ol>
         <li> Increase ease of use by 4% to match the desktop UX metric.</li>
         <li> Enable faster checkout through skipping some of the existing steps.</li>
         <li> Provide action confirmation and essential information sooner than checkout, e.g shipping and pricing estimates.</li>
         <li> Reduce checkout steps to decrease perception of too many steps.</li>

    <p class="zoom-in">Interstitial<p>

    <p>An interstitial was added to confirm the customer's action. We landed on this decision by looking at other best in class websites, conducting testing and looking at our order history. The majority
    of customers making a purchase, checkout with a single item. This feature would allow them to bypass the full page cart step thus getting to checkout faster. An additional opportunity  was informing the user on final costs up-front
  as they were building the cart. The initial feedback on the old design had led us to the insight that many customers were surprised to see additional charges (taxes, fees &amp; shipping) and abandoned checkout because of the disparity.</p>

    <p class="zoom-in">Cart<p>

    <p>The previous mini cart page was causing technical bugs &amp; and visual confusion for users. The team decided to move away from the interaction
      where the cart icon triggered the mini cart. Instead, a full cart-page was put into place. The idea behind was not only to solve the tech issues, but allow
      the user to have a place where they could edit, review &amp; confirm. The needs for this was especially true for the type of products that are sold on the T&amp;N
      website where most customers are purchasing big ticket items.

  <div class="explanation">
      <p class="zoom-in">Checkout Page<p>

    <p>Express pay was added to the checkout page and the steps were streamlined to eliminate the "shipping information" step. The product container layout was updated, to allow for
      more readability of all the pieces information within this small space. The "order summary" section was moved toward the button of the page, as users prefered to see it closer to the payment step, to avoid scrolling up and down to confirm the costs.

    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>Through a mix of research tools like hotjar (heatmaps, interactions), heuristic analysis, UX benchmarking, competitive audit, qualitative testing,
  the team compiled a list of user pain points, some of which are listed below: </p>

    </div>

  <div class="list">
      <ol>
        <li>Users don’t know how to change shipping options when it’s not clearly visible during checkout. Some users don’t see the order summary section. and even when they open it, their eyes skip over the shipping section.</li>
        <li>Users have the impression that the one page checkout is shorter and faster</li>
        <li>Users are confused about multiple promotion interaction/stacking.</li>
        <li>Cart: users leverage cart as a comparison tool, not necessarily to purchase.</li>
        <li>Cart: We do not provide an estimated shipping cost or shipping options up front that can affect cost in cart.</li>
        <li>Shipping: in store pickup should be made available to users who want to save on shipping and pick up same day.</li>
      </ol>

    </div>

  <div class="extra-info">
      <h3>Opportunities</h3>
      <p>The checkout re-design project has been a major goal for the overall business and our conversion rate goals for the year are heavily reliant
      on the success of this project. The team prioritized the following opportunities over a long list of changes to slowly roll out features and measure
      each of the features against specific goals.</p>

    <div class="list">

        <ol>
          <li><span>Information Upfront</span>, by adding fee &amp; tax information at the cart level and PDP level we are ensuring users won't be surprised at checkout and avoiding abandoned carts.</li>
          <li><span>Express checkout options</span>, necessary for today's customer that uses specific payment options and expect those to be ubiquitous. If as a website you don't have those options, you migh lose against a competitor who does.</li>
          <li><span>Improved layout for visibility &amp; readability of important information</span>, such as shipping estimates, promo pricing &amp; delay/warning messages.</li>
          <li><span>Restructuring of required personal information with microinteracions in the right places</span>, to create perception of a shorter process.</li>

    <h2>Exploration <br> &amp; Iteration</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="right">
    <p class= "explanation">My role as a design manager was to ideate along Brooke, synthesize insights into actionable ideas, help prioritize features considered and provide UX &amp; UI direction and feedback.
      As the 2 designers in the team, Brooke &amp: I, relied constantly on user feedback to improve our designs. CX, Engineering and the rest of the design team also provided feedback in the process. Ultimately
    our goal with the visual design was to improve the Aesthetic and implement a minimal design to allow for the important information to be processed by the end user.</p>


    <!--<p class= "explanation">These had all been customer requests for years in our backlog, as they solved key use cases for our users to collaborate with their teammates and provide feedback. However, because they were unable to do this in Box, we were forcing our use other software to annotate and markup their content. This created an annoying back-and-forth process
    for our users who simply stored their content in Box, but did the actual editing and iteration elsewhere.</p>-->

    used actions was central as I moved forward to a final state. </p>

      <h3>Outcome</h3>
      <p>This has been a great project to work on. Especially, because I've been able to shape the design &amp;. I really wanted this project to follow best in class ecommerce patterns for our specific customers and
      emphasized the importance of constantly using research as way to validate our assumptions. Experimentation has also been a big part of this, since the design proposes variations in how the information can be presented
    to enable a learning process through metrics. Furthermore, each portion of the design has been released and measured against the original to demonstrate the overall value of this project to the business.</p>


  <br>
        <p>Here's a list of important challenges and learnings for this project:</p>


  <br>
        <p class="zoom-in">A/B Test as Tool for measuring impact</p>
        <p>It's been great to A/B test against the original version and see how much revenue we've made with small changes. When the interstitial was launches we saw a significant increment in our CRO.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="zoom-in">Eng Collab</p>
        <p>Tight collaboration with Engineering has been key in the sucess of this project. Sharing A/B testing, user-testing, interaction recording results has won buy in on many of the things we proposed.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="zoom-in">Feature Iteration</p>
        <p>Coming up with an implemenation plan with engineering has allowed us to see results within weeks. Designing with an iterative mindset has allowed the business to understand that even when we have design vision, it is meant to be implemented in portions,
        and that the paced releases allow us to learn &amp; iterate that vision as we go.</p>
